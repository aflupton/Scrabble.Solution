## Description

_An app that finds the base Scrabble score of any word entered into the user interface._

* _The program should use the following values to score words given by the user._
  * _Ex: input: "A", "E", "I", "O", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T" ; output: "1 point"_
  * _Ex: input: "D", "G" ; output: "2 points"_
  * _Ex: input: "B", "C", "M", "P" ; output: "3 points"_
  * _Ex: input: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y" ; output: "4 points"_
  * _Ex: input: "K" ; output: "5 points"_
  * _Ex: input: "J", "K" ; output: "8 points"_
  * _Ex: input: "Q", "Z" ; output: "10 points"_

* _The program should calculate word values by adding together the values of each individual character._

* _The program should only accept standard letters of the English alphabet, and should return an input error for non-alphabetic characters and numbers._
  * _Ex: input: "$369" ; output: "Please enter a standard scrabble word."_
  * _Ex: input: "fr1D4y" ; output: "Please enter a standard scrabble word."_

* _The program should treat lower-case and upper-case letters as equivalent._
  * _Ex: input: "START" || "start" ; output: "Your score is: 5"_

* _The program should handle single-letter inputs._
  * _Ex: input: "i"/"I" or "a"/"A" ; output: "Your score is: 1"_

* _The program should handle multiple-letter inputs._
  * _Ex: input: "esquire" ; output: "Your score is: 16"_
